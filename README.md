# Ember-cli-deploy-couchdb

> An ember-cli-deploy plugin to upload files to CouchDB

[![](https://ember-cli-deploy.github.io/ember-cli-deploy-version-badges/plugins/ember-cli-deploy-couchdb.svg)](http://ember-cli-deploy.github.io/ember-cli-deploy-version-badges/)

This plugin uploads an Ember App to a CouchDB design doc. The Ember App is served directly to the browser from CouchDB, without any other software in the stack.

## What is an ember-cli-deploy plugin?

A plugin is an addon that can be executed as a part of the ember-cli-deploy pipeline. A plugin will implement one or more of the ember-cli-deploy's pipeline hooks.

For more information on what plugins are and how they work, please refer to the [Plugin Documentation][1].

## Quick Start

To get up and running quickly, do the following:

- Ensure [ember-cli-deploy-build-plus][2] is installed and configured, or if you need to use [ember-cli-deploy-build][5], that you have the additional configurations described below in place.

- Install this plugin

```bash
$ ember install ember-cli-deploy-couchdb
```

- Place the following configuration into `config/deploy.js`

```javascript
ENV.couchdb = {
  db: 'http://localhost:5984/emberapp'

  // optionally, if you are using ember-cli-deploy-build instead of
  // ember-cli-deploy-build-plus, also include the following

  // ddocname: emberapp,
  // couchDir: 'tmp/deploy-dist',
  // distDir: 'tmp/deploy-dist/_attachments'
}
```

If you are using ember-cli-deploy-build, you will also need to add the following to your build hook
```javascript
ENV.build = {
  outputPath: 'tmp/deploy-dist/_attachments'
}
```

- Place the following configuration into `config/environment.js` where `ddocname` is normaly the same as `modulePrefix:`. `ddocname` can be changed in the configuration options.

```javascript
if (environment === 'production') {
  ENV.baseURL = '/emberapp/_design/ddocname/_rewrite/';
}
```

If a [vhost][3] is used do the following:

```javascript
if (environment === 'production') {
  ENV.baseURL = '/';
}
```

- Run the pipeline

```bash
$ ember deploy
```

## Installation
Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
ember install ember-cli-deploy-couchdb
```
